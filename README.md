# hyperGUI
A Versatile Tool for Hyperspectral Image Analysis and Data Extraction

## User Guide
HyperGUI is based on two datasets which can be accessed via these links: [A dataset for benchtop hyperspectral image](https://gsi.geodata.gov.ie/downloads/Bedrock/Data/Hyperspectral_Sample_data.zip) and [a dataset for aerial hyperspectral image](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5ph8ms8p5n/2). Checking these sample datasets will help with utilizing the software.

### Benchtop sample
For a benchtop sample first load the raw and hdr files of the image while selecting labratory as type of hyperspectral.
