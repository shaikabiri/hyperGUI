# hyperGUI
A Versatile Tool for Hyperspectral Image Analysis and Data Extraction

## User Guide
HyperGUI is based on two datasets which can be accessed via these links: [A dataset for benchtop hyperspectral image](https://gsi.geodata.gov.ie/downloads/Bedrock/Data/Hyperspectral_Sample_data.zip) and [a dataset for aerial hyperspectral image](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5ph8ms8p5n/2). Checking these sample datasets will help with utilizing the software.

### Benchtop sample
For a benchtop sample first load the raw and hdr files of the image while selecting labratory as type of hyperspectral.

If available upload the raw and hdr files of the white and dark current seperately.

After loading the data and references, and dark/white current calibration or dark pixel subtraction in case no references are available can be selected to perform.
